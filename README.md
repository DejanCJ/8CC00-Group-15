## Project Overview

We created a "check_all_thresholds" file to identify optimal thresholds for model optimization. 
After determining the best thresholds, we developed a pipeline that runs the entire model using these optimized thresholds,
ensuring improved performance. The other files are part of the data analysis conducted throughout the project.
